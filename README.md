 Christmas Lights Animation (2012-13)

Proposed/Advised by: June Alexander-Knight

Sponsored by: L3 

Project Description:
 Use an embedded Linux single board computer such as a Raspberry Pi ($35) or BeagleBone ($89) as the Christmas light's controller.  Both boards have a complete software development environment on them to write the controller code in C++ or Python.  Same hardware as before, with the addition of circuits that are able to switch 120VAC. An 8 channel switch that can be controlled via GPIO pins is available on the internet for about $20-$30. The simple version will merely switch lights on and off according to some predefined sequence. A more advanced version will allow the lights to be synchronized to music. In this case, the smartphone controller is more likely a PC/Mac running a MIDI sequencer. (Google “MIDI”) Each light could be represented as a specific MIDI note. Your Linux board then looks like a MIDI instrument to the sequencer. You use the sequencer software to “program” the light show.
