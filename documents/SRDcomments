>5.1.1 User Story #1 Breakdown

This information is contained in your sprint reports.  I do expect to see the backlog for 
each sprint.   Keep in mind this is a communications and teaming course, not a technology
course.   I have seen requirements and testing documents that are well in excess of 100 pages.
However, I will leave it to you to determine if user stories need to be broken into tasks 
and probably the level of detail you are asking about it not necessary.  The "design docs" 
should be very complete.  

As for your SRD, I expect to see the three sprints, backlogs and associated activities.
